# About
Developed a simple program in C that demonstrates fundamental algorithmic concepts through a menu-driven system. The program includes the following features:
	Display → Shows all stored data in a structured format.
	Search → Allows users to find specific data entries using a keyword.
	Sort → Sorts the dataset based on a chosen attribute, ensuring easier analysis and readability.
	Export → Saves the data into a .txt file for external use.
	Exit → Closes the program safely.

This project highlights the implementation of essential programming techniques such as array manipulation, string handling, searching, sorting algorithms, and file handling in the C programming language.
